# Data Structures

This is my coursework from my Data Structures course I took in Spring 2016 at San Francisco State University.

Projects include, in order:
- Fraction Calculator
- LISP Expression Evaluator
- Bank Simulator
- Video Poker Game

I am withholding the course ID from this repo to avoid plagiarism from current and future attending students.

Disclaimer: These projects were coded without utilizing GitHub, therefore there are not many commits involving development in this repo.
