# Fraction Calculator

A program that adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, compares, simplifies fractions. It can also convert fractions into decimal values.

Learned how to use multiple files, implement interfaces, use try-catch blocks, and use constructors to create objects.

How to run (assuming in FractionCalculator directory):
- javac FC_Test.java
- java FC_Test

How to use:
- Select an operation to perform. The user can select to (0) exit, (1) add, (2) subtract, (3) multiply, (4) divide, (5) compare, (6) check if equal, (7) simplify, (8) convert to decimal, or (9) create fraction(s).
- When performing operations 0 through 6, the program will ask the user to input two fractions.
- When performing operations 7 through 9, the program will ask the user to input one fraction.
- After the operation is complete, it will display test data and outputs. The output for the operation is the last line of the test data.
